# Template initialization

The released `preset` Nx generator captures the choices that distinguish one generated application repository from another. The root `initialize:workspace` command invokes this public entry point. Repeating the command with the same options produces byte-for-byte identical repository content.

```bash
pnpm initialize:workspace customer-portal \
  --displayName="Customer Portal" \
  --packageScope=@acme \
  --repositoryOwner=acme-platform \
  --codeowners=@acme/platform,@acme/security \
  --applications=web,api,worker \
  --webPort=3100 \
  --apiPort=4100 \
  --databasePort=55432 \
  --databaseName=customer_portal \
  --authentication=oidc \
  --workerTransport=postgres \
  --telemetry=true \
  --deploymentProfile=containers \
  --ai=true
```

Initialization changes the local plugin package scope, so refresh workspace links before invoking another generator:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm template:identity:check
```

Use `docs/getting-started.md` for required local tooling, profile-selection guidance, the complete first-run sequence, preview validation, and production replacement points. Generated repository owners should complete `docs/generated-project-checklist.md` before opening the project to a team or connecting a deployment environment.

## Generated initialization contract

The preset writes `workspace.template.json` as the canonical, versioned record of initialization choices. Identity-neutral workspaces use schema version 2. The manifest contains:

- application slug, display name, and npm package scope
- repository owner and normalized CODEOWNERS
- selected `web`, `api`, and `worker` applications
- web, API, and database ports plus the database name
- authentication, worker transport, telemetry, deployment, and optional AI profiles
- the upstream template repository and exact originating template version used for attribution and future upgrade metadata

The public preset also removes template-maintainer-only release workflows, changelog files, release scripts, validation fixtures, and release commands. The generated workspace's local plugin remains available for structural generators but is marked private so it cannot be published accidentally.

The generated repository retains the downstream-facing onboarding, project checklist, runtime support, architecture, delivery, security, runbook, and template-upgrade documentation. These files are part of the generated handoff and must not depend on template-maintainer release permissions.

## Supported profile behavior

The generator accepts these profile values:

- `applications`: any non-empty compatible selection of `web`, `api`, and `worker`
- `authentication`: `development`, `none`, `oidc`, or `session`
- `workerTransport`: `none`, `postgres`, or `redis`
- `telemetry`: `true` or `false`
- `deploymentProfile`: `containers`, `kubernetes`, or `local`
- `ai`: `true` or `false`

Profile values are durable repository metadata. Their runtime behavior is:

- `development` authentication and `local` deployment are development-only choices. The development verifier rejects production use.
- `oidc` selects the reference API access-token verifier documented in `docs/oidc-authentication.md` and the in-memory browser credential adapter documented in `docs/browser-authentication.md`. The generated owner must configure the issuer, audience, algorithm allowlist, claim mapping, and provider operations, including application-owned login, callback, logout, and secure-session routes.
- `session` selects the same browser credential adapter for an application-owned server session. The adapter obtains and renews short-lived API access tokens without persisting them in browser storage; the generated owner must still implement login, callback, logout, and the secure same-origin session credential endpoint.
- `postgres` selects the baseline transport direction documented in `docs/adr/0010-worker-delivery.md`: a transport boundary with PostgreSQL outbox polling, lease-based claims, at-least-once delivery, idempotent handlers, retries, and quarantine. `redis` records a future adapter direction only; it does not add Redis to Compose, configure `REDIS_URL`, or make that transport runnable. An adopter selecting it must supply an adapter with equivalent semantics, infrastructure, tests, and operational ownership.
- `kubernetes` records the deployment target but does not generate organization-specific cluster, ingress, secret, policy, or autoscaling configuration.
- `ai=true` deliberately composes the existing provider-neutral Phase 14 capabilities into the API package graph: model interfaces, runtime-validated tools, evaluation, durable execution, governance, contracts, and observability. It materializes only the package entry points needed for those selected capabilities and generates an AI-only API reference workflow, a deterministic test, and profile-specific guidance. The reference demonstrates streaming, a single typed tool, durable checkpoints and approval, evaluation evidence, correlated telemetry, data classification, retention-compatible routing, bounded fallback, tool allowlisting, invocation authorization, and trusted human approval without selecting a model-provider SDK or orchestration framework.
- `ai=false` remains the default. It removes the generated AI workflow, AI-specific API dependencies and project references, and optional Phase 14 package entry points. The default generated workspace is validated to contain no model-provider runtime dependency.

The complete compatibility rules and production replacement points are explained in `docs/getting-started.md`.

## Repository-wide identity replacement

Initialization rewrites every text file outside generated caches and dependency directories. It parameterizes:

- the internal npm scope and all workspace imports
- package names, generator commands, lockfile entries, and custom TypeScript conditions
- service, Compose project, telemetry, database-client, and application identifiers
- OCI image prefixes, image references, and deployment labels
- database defaults in environment files and Compose health checks
- generated CODEOWNERS and application-specific ownership paths

Binary files and ignored build directories are not modified. Intentional references to the upstream template, `kaleigh-dem/steady-stack`, are preserved only in attribution, generator metadata, tests of that metadata, and `workspace.template.json`.

Applications omitted from `--applications` are removed from `apps/`, their root TypeScript project references are removed, and container builds are scoped to the selected applications.

## Validation rules

Initialization fails before writing files when options are invalid or incompatible:

- slugs must be lowercase kebab case; package scopes must be lowercase npm scopes
- repository owners and CODEOWNERS must use valid GitHub or email forms
- ports must be unique integers from 1 through 65535
- database names must use lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores
- authentication requires the API; session authentication also requires the web application
- a configured worker transport requires the worker application, and a selected worker requires a transport
- optional AI capabilities require both web and API applications

Lists are trimmed, deduplicated, and written in stable order. The manifest contains no timestamps or machine-specific paths.

`pnpm template:identity:check` scans the entire initialized repository and fails when it finds the upstream package scope, service slug, snake/camel/Pascal identity forms, or the original personal CODEOWNER outside the approved upstream metadata allowlist. CI runs deterministic generation checks, verifies the recorded template version and release-tool cleanup, executes the identity detector, validates Nx synchronization, exercises the ordinary generated workspace lifecycle, proves default-profile AI isolation, and separately validates the generated AI profile with a frozen install, repository checks, generated workflow tests, Nx graph assertions, and source/generated-workspace cleanliness.
