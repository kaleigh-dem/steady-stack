# Generated workspace onboarding

This guide covers the first decisions and commands for a repository created from the released template. It is intentionally written for generated application owners rather than upstream template maintainers.

The generated repository is designed for products that may be built substantially by humans and AI agents. Initialization retains layered `AGENTS.md` guidance, Nx project and MCP context, local generators, executable boundaries, validation commands, and upgrade tooling. See `docs/agentic-development.md` before establishing an agent-led workflow.

## Required local tooling

Install these tools before initializing or running a workspace:

- Git
- Node.js 24 LTS; the repository includes `.node-version`
- Corepack with pnpm 10.13.1
- Docker Engine with Docker Compose v2 for PostgreSQL, images, and preview validation
- a GitHub account with permission to create the target repository and configure its settings
- optionally, an agent client that supports Model Context Protocol when using the checked-in Nx MCP configuration

Confirm the runtime before installing dependencies:

```bash
node --version
corepack enable
pnpm --version
docker version
docker compose version
```

The supported Node.js and pnpm ranges are enforced by `package.json`. See `docs/runtime-support.md` for the runtime upgrade policy.

## Initialize the checked-out template content

After creating the repository from the released template source, install dependencies and apply its permanent identity and profiles:

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm initialize:workspace customer-portal \
  --displayName="Customer Portal" \
  --packageScope=@acme \
  --repositoryOwner=acme-platform \
  --codeowners=@acme/platform,@acme/security \
  --applications=web,api,worker \
  --authentication=development \
  --workerTransport=postgres \
  --deploymentProfile=containers
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm template:identity:check
```

Add `--ai=true` only when the product deliberately needs the optional runtime AI reference profile. It requires both `web` and `api` and does not affect coding-agent compatibility.

Use the tagged template release and matching workspace-plugin artifact when reproducibility across multiple repositories matters. The generated `workspace.template.json` records the originating release, selected applications, ports, database name, repository ownership, and profile choices.

## Establish the agentic development baseline

Before assigning implementation work to an agent, inspect and customize the repository context:

```bash
cat AGENTS.md
find apps packages tools -name AGENTS.md -print
pnpm nx show projects
pnpm nx show project web
cat .mcp.json
```

- Keep the root `AGENTS.md` focused on repository-wide rules.
- Update nested instruction files when a subsystem gains application-specific constraints.
- Use the Nx graph and project metadata to identify ownership and dependencies.
- Compatible agent clients can start the checked-in Nx MCP server with `pnpm nx mcp`.
- Keep product decisions in maintained documentation or ADRs rather than relying on a prior agent conversation.
- Use local generators for repeated structures rather than manually copying directories.

The MCP integration is optional and does not replace repository instructions or validation.

## Supported profiles

Profile choices are recorded in `workspace.template.json`. Some choices configure a complete local path; others declare the production integration that the generated repository must supply.

| Setting          | Supported values                         | Default                                                | Current behavior and production note |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Applications     | `web`, `api`, `worker`                   | all three                                              | Unselected applications are removed. Authentication requires `api`; session authentication also requires `web`; a selected worker requires a transport. |
| Authentication   | `development`, `none`, `oidc`, `session` | `development` when `api` is selected, otherwise `none` | `development` supplies the fixed local token path and rejects production use. `oidc` uses the reference discovery/JWKS access-token verifier documented in `docs/oidc-authentication.md`; generated owners must configure issuer, audience, algorithms, and claim mapping. `oidc` and `session` use the reference in-memory browser credential adapter documented in `docs/browser-authentication.md`. Adopters still own provider login/callback/logout handling and the secure server-session route that returns short-lived access tokens. |
| Worker transport | `none`, `postgres`, `redis`              | `postgres` when `worker` is selected, otherwise `none` | PostgreSQL outbox polling is the only baseline implementation and follows `docs/adr/0010-worker-delivery.md`. `redis` records a future adapter direction only; it does not provision Redis or make that transport runnable. Any non-baseline adapter must supply equivalent delivery semantics, infrastructure, tests, and operations. |
| Telemetry        | `true`, `false`                          | `false`                                                | `true` enables local OTLP defaults. Production still requires an owned collector or observability backend, credentials, retention, sampling, and alerting. |
| Deployment       | `containers`, `kubernetes`, `local`      | `containers`                                           | `containers` supports the repository preview lifecycle. `kubernetes` records the target but does not replace platform-specific manifests, ingress, secrets, autoscaling, or policy. `local` is not a production deployment profile. |
| Optional AI      | `true`, `false`                          | `false`                                                | `true` composes only the existing provider-neutral Phase 14 model, typed-tool, evaluation, durable-execution, governance, streaming-contract, and observability boundaries into the API and generates an AI-only API reference workflow plus deterministic tests and guidance. The example streams versioned events, invokes one runtime-validated tool, checkpoints durable state, preserves explicit classification/retention/fallback/tool-policy/human-approval boundaries, emits correlated payload-safe telemetry, and produces synthetic evaluation evidence. It installs no model-provider SDK or orchestration framework. `false` removes the AI composition; CI proves the ordinary generated profile has no model-provider runtime dependency. |

The generator rejects incompatible combinations before writing files. See `docs/template-initialization.md` for every option and validation rule.

## First local run

Create the local environment, start dependencies, apply the database schema, and run the selected applications:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
pnpm infra:up
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed
pnpm db:status
pnpm dev
```

Default local endpoints are:

- web: `http://localhost:3000`
- API: `http://localhost:4000`
- PostgreSQL: `localhost:5432`

Initialization rewrites these defaults when custom ports are selected. Start the optional local OpenTelemetry collector with `pnpm telemetry:up` when telemetry is enabled.

Before the first commit, run:

```bash
pnpm format
pnpm check
pnpm template:identity:check
git status --short
```

Agents should report the exact commands run, projects changed, generated files or migrations, and any remaining human decision. Review the diff rather than relying on the completion summary alone.

Stop local dependencies with `pnpm infra:down` and the telemetry collector with `pnpm telemetry:down`.

## Validate the production-shaped path

The container preview is the closest local equivalent to the required delivery workflow:

```bash
pnpm preview:up
pnpm performance:load
pnpm preview:down
```

`preview:up` builds the images, starts dependencies, applies migrations, starts services, and runs its configured smoke profile. `pnpm preview:down` should be safe to run again. Validation must leave the Git working tree clean.

## Production replacement points

Treat the following as explicit ownership decisions before a generated application is deployed:

1. **Identity:** configure the reference OIDC verifier or another `AccessTokenVerifier` and the reference browser credential adapter, then provide provider login, callback, logout, and secure-session routes. Define issuer, audience, permission mapping, token or session renewal, key rotation, and outage behavior. See `docs/oidc-authentication.md` and `docs/browser-authentication.md`.
2. **Secrets and configuration:** move credentials and environment-specific values out of repository files; use protected GitHub Environments or the target platform's secret manager.
3. **Data services:** provision production PostgreSQL with TLS, least-privilege credentials, backups, restore tests, retention, and capacity ownership. Add another durable service only when an implemented adapter or distributed control gives it a concrete responsibility.
4. **Worker delivery:** implement the selected transport's leasing or queue semantics, at-least-once idempotency, classified retries, quarantine and replay, bounded shutdown, and operational metrics defined by `docs/adr/0010-worker-delivery.md`.
5. **Distributed controls:** run the PostgreSQL rate-limit adapter, configure anonymous, authenticated, route, and tenant thresholds, and verify the trusted ingress hop count for the deployment. See `docs/rate-limiting.md`.
6. **Telemetry:** configure the production exporter, sampling, redaction, retention, dashboards, alerts, and incident ownership.
7. **Deployment:** replace local Compose assumptions with owned image registry, domains, TLS, ingress, autoscaling, health probes, rollout, rollback, and environment policy.
8. **Seed and sample data:** remove or restrict development identities and sample records; define migration and data-repair ownership.
9. **Optional AI runtime:** when `ai=true`, keep provider/model routing and credentials server-owned behind `ModelClient`; choose only routes compatible with classification, residency, retention, tool, streaming, and fallback policy; supply a production durable adapter with named owner, purpose, retention/deletion, tenant isolation, encryption, access control, backup/restore, and regional guarantees; configure tool allowlists and invocation authorization independently; authorize human approvals from trusted application identity; retain only payload-safe audit/trace data; and maintain reviewed synthetic or explicitly approved evaluation evidence. The generated deterministic adapter and in-memory durable adapter are reference/test components, not production provider or persistence choices.
10. **Repository and agent governance:** review CODEOWNERS, team and agent access, required checks, branch protection, protected environments, dependency update policy, release permissions, and human approval boundaries.
