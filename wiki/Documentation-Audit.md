# Documentation Audit

This page records the audit scope, information architecture, coverage matrix, verified command inventory, discrepancies, page disposition, and unresolved topics behind this wiki.

## Prerequisites

- None. This page is primarily for repository administrators, documentation owners, and template maintainers.

## Audit method

The wiki was derived from implementation and maintained repository documents, including:

- root `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.mcp.json`, `package.json`, `nx.json`, `.env.example`, Compose
- application and database `project.json` files
- workspace plugin generator registry, schemas, shared utilities, and implementations
- GitHub Actions CI, Security, Delivery, Generated workspace, image release, digest promotion, release-record finalization, disaster-recovery, and wiki publication workflows
- getting started, initialization, architecture, authentication, rate limiting, database, worker, delivery, production readiness, upgrade, release, validation, runtime, security, migration, model/tool/stream/evaluation, durable-agent-execution, agent-safety-and-governance, and runbook documentation
- nested `AGENTS.md` files for web, API, worker, contracts, database, Agent Task domain, web feature, worker job, backend model, backend agent-tool, backend agent-eval, backend-agent-durable, and backend-agent-governance projects
- performance budget and smoke-test implementation
- merged PR #50 supply-chain evidence, PR #52 immutable promotion, PR #55 CI diagnostics, PR #59 cache-input auditing, PR #61 SteadyStack identity rebrand, PR #64 release records/recovery evidence, PRs #65–#68 for the Phase 14 profile, model, tool/stream, and evaluation boundaries, PR #70 durable execution, PR #71 safety/governance hooks, and the P14-07 generated AI-profile implementation and exact-head validation in PR #80

The hidden GitHub wiki Git repository is not exposed through the ordinary repository contents API and does not support the main repository's pull-request workflow. Reviewed source is maintained under `wiki/`. After a reviewed wiki change reaches `main`, `.github/workflows/wiki-publish.yml` synchronizes it to `steady-stack.wiki.git`, preserves wiki-only pages except those explicitly listed in `wiki/deletions.txt`, and rejects every unapproved deletion. `docs/wiki-publication.md` documents the manual fallback.

## Verified commands

“Verified” means the command was matched to a root script, Nx target, generator schema, or implementation path. It does not mean this documentation session executed Docker or installed dependencies.

`pnpm docs:architecture` and `pnpm docs:check` are P13-05 template-maintainer commands. In `@steadystack/source`, they generate/check the committed Nx architecture graph and run the documentation content/topology audit. Initialized products retain the deterministic checker tests but skip the upstream content/topology audit; product teams must add product-specific rules if they want equivalent enforcement.

`pnpm agent-eval:check` is the P14-04 evidence gate. It validates committed evidence manifests and, when Nx supplies a comparison range in CI, requires evidence updates for governed prompt artifacts and non-test model/tool runtime behavior changes.

Template-maintainer-only release scripts were intentionally not presented as generated-workspace everyday commands. Release-record finalization and the quarterly restore exercise are GitHub Actions workflows rather than root package scripts.

## Discrepancies and important reconciliations

### Documentation integrity is upstream-specific

P13-05 adds deterministic documentation-integrity enforcement for the reviewed upstream template package, `@steadystack/source`. Initialization changes product identity, can remove projects through profile selection, and removes maintainer-only workflows and documents. For that reason, initialized products run the checker’s deterministic unit tests but intentionally skip the upstream content/topology audit. The wiki labels `pnpm docs:check` and `pnpm docs:architecture` accordingly and directs adopters to define product-owned rules when they need equivalent enforcement.

### SteadyStack public identity

SteadyStack is the canonical repository-owned identity. Current package manifests, generator guidance, upgrade commands, release artifacts, repository links, wiki publication, authentication defaults, and generated-workspace provenance use the SteadyStack forms. Generated products choose and retain their own application identity.

The repository had no released generated users before the SteadyStack public identity became canonical. For that reason, the end-user wiki documents only current names and does not publish a separate identity-transition guide. Historical mapping and compatibility details remain in `docs/steadystack-migration.md` for maintainers.

### Reviewed rendered-wiki deletions

Checked-in Markdown remains the authoritative reviewed page set. Pages that exist only in the rendered wiki are preserved by default. A rendered page is deleted only when its top-level `.md` filename is listed in `wiki/deletions.txt`, the corresponding reviewed source is absent, navigation no longer references it, and no unapproved deletion is staged. The manifest remains as an auditable, idempotent record.

### Agentic compatibility versus optional product AI

Agentic compatibility is a baseline repository property implemented through `AGENTS.md`, Nx graph and MCP context, generators, executable boundaries, validation, and upgrades. The `ai` initialization flag selects an optional product AI profile; it does not control repository agent readiness.

Phase 14 is complete through P14-07. The reusable upstream runtime boundaries provide provider-neutral model interfaces and adapters, typed authorization-enforced tools, a strict V1 NDJSON browser stream, reviewed prompt/evaluation evidence, replaceable durable execution with leases, fencing, checkpoints, human-approval pauses, and interruption recovery, plus safety/governance hooks for runtime policy, sensitive-data handling, server-owned tool allowlists, trusted approval authorization, payload-safe audit events, and bounded compatible provider/model fallback. `ai=false` remains the default and removes the optional AI application dependencies. Selecting `ai=true` materializes the selected Phase 14 package entry points, adds API dependencies/project references, and generates a provider-neutral reference workflow and focused tests. The reviewed generator source is `tools/workspace-plugin/src/generators/init/ai-reference-template.ts`. Generated-workspace validation proves both default-profile isolation and the AI-enabled lifecycle.

The generated reference does not make a provider SDK, provider credential, orchestration framework, vector database, or production durable-persistence implementation mandatory. Those remain adopter-owned production replacement points.

### Worker operations port exposure

`docs/worker-operations.md` says the operations port is intended to be internal and not host-published by the baseline deployment. `infra/deploy/compose.preview.yaml` maps `4001:4001` to support local smoke and performance checks. The wiki documents the implementation and warns that production exposure is a deployment decision.

### Preview command duplication

Several overview sequences show:

```bash
pnpm containers:build
pnpm preview:up
pnpm preview:smoke
```

The `preview:up` implementation itself builds images and runs smoke after startup. The wiki explains that the explicit build and smoke commands are useful for isolation or repetition but are redundant in the shortest path.

### Image publication, promotion, deployment, and finalization are separate

The release implementation uses one-time image publication plus read-only production promotion. The adopting platform then performs deployment. P13-06 adds a protected post-deployment `Finalize release record` workflow that binds the exact successful release and promotion runs to the provider-specific backup identifier, approved migration steps, rollback window/schema decision, supply-chain artifacts, and deployed smoke results. None of the publication, promotion, or finalization workflows silently substitutes for the deployment platform.

### Redis and Kubernetes profile status

Both are valid initialization metadata, but Redis delivery and organization-specific Kubernetes deployment are not implemented. The wiki does not describe them as operational.

### OIDC/session completeness

The repository implements an OIDC API verifier and browser credential adapter. Provider login/callback/logout and the secure server-session credential endpoint remain adopter-owned. The wiki preserves this distinction.

### CI cancellation, cache, and failure evidence

PR #55 completed pull-request-only cancellation, optional BuildKit cache reuse, and retained diagnostics. Delivery uses `.cache/buildkit`; Generated workspace stores cache state outside its temporary source copy at `../buildkit-cache`. Cache failure affects speed, not correctness. Failure bundles are retained for 14 days.

P13-05 extends the retained CI bundle for stale documentation architecture validation: the expected `project-graph.md` is written into the CI diagnostics directory so reviewers can compare the generated correction candidate with the committed graph. CI Diagnostics documents this failure class and the `pnpm docs:architecture` / `pnpm docs:check` remediation path.

### Artifact retention is bounded

The supply-chain artifact defaults to 30-day retention. Production promotion, finalized release records, and the quarterly repository restore-exercise evidence default to 90 days. The wiki treats those GitHub artifacts as bounded handoff/review copies and requires adopters to persist complete release-record bundles in their durable system of record when rollback, audit, incident, or regulatory retention exceeds that window.

The quarterly isolated PostgreSQL restore exercise proves the repository baseline recovery path; it does not replace provider-specific production DR testing for snapshot access, encryption/key recovery, permissions, networking, traffic switching, reconciliation, and declared RPO/RTO.

### `pnpm check` scope

`pnpm check` includes `pnpm agent-eval:check` immediately after documentation integrity. It still does not run identity validation, telemetry Compose validation, preview lifecycle, production readiness, a real provider reachability test, or release-record finalization. Those are documented separately.

## Topics not confidently documentable from implementation

### Organization-specific agent platform and access model

Needed information:

- approved coding-agent products and hosting model
- repository permission level and branch strategy
- credential lifetime and secret-broker design
- allowed external tools and network destinations
- data-classification restrictions
- audit-log and session-retention requirements
- human approval points and emergency revocation owner

### Organization-specific durable release-evidence retention

The repository creates validated release-record bundles and retains GitHub handoff copies for 90 days, but an adopting organization must still define:

- durable evidence store and retention duration
- export/ingestion automation and access policy
- legal or regulatory requirements and incident holds
- deletion policy
- accountable evidence owner

### Provider-specific login/session implementation

Needed information:

- chosen identity provider
- application/client type
- callback and logout URLs
- session store and cookie policy
- refresh/token exchange method
- role/permission mapping
- provider SDK and operational owner

### Real production deployment

Needed information:

- cloud/platform and region
- registry and workload identity
- ingress/TLS/DNS
- secret/config mechanism
- migration job
- scaling and rollout controller
- environment approval
- deployment and rollback commands

### Production model-provider composition

SteadyStack supplies a generated optional AI reference profile but intentionally does not choose production composition. Needed information includes:

- approved provider/model/region allowlist and credentials
- application data-classification and retention policy
- provider-side retention/training terms
- tool allowlist and audit policy
- prompt/application persistence policy
- fallback and safety policy
- production durable-execution adapter when required
- quality/latency/token/cost budgets and production monitoring

### Redis worker transport

Needed information:

- adapter code and contract
- infrastructure
- durable ownership semantics
- retry/dead-letter/replay behavior
- metrics and operations
- backup/recovery
- tests proving parity

### Kubernetes deployment

Needed information:

- manifests or chart
- namespaces and service accounts
- ingress and network policy
- secret references
- probes and resources
- autoscaling/disruption budgets
- migration and rollout jobs

### Backup provider and exact RPO/RTO

Needed information:

- PostgreSQL provider
- backup frequency/retention
- cross-account or immutable storage
- provider-specific restore procedure and measured duration
- approved business RPO/RTO
- named owners

## Final review against end-user tasks

The page set provides a direct path to:

- understand SteadyStack's agentic-development purpose and approval model
- configure a safe agent access and repository governance model
- create and initialize a workspace
- run it locally
- make and validate a focused change
- generate a domain, feature, contract, or job
- understand synchronous and asynchronous architecture
- select, inspect, and safely extend the generated optional AI reference profile and its model/tool/stream/evaluation/durable/governance boundaries
- build and validate the preview environment
- identify production replacement points
- publish/promote immutable images and finalize production release evidence
- perform a dry-run and applied upgrade
- diagnose common runtime, delivery, release-record, recovery, and CI symptoms

Runtime execution should still be repeated in the generated repository's CI and target environment because documentation verification cannot replace the repository's own test and delivery contracts.
