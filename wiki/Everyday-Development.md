# Everyday Development

This page documents the repository-level commands humans and AI agents use during normal work, the standard agent iteration loop, and when focused Nx commands are preferable.

## Prerequisites

- Dependencies installed with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.
- A local `.env` file for application and database work.
- Docker running for PostgreSQL-backed flows and integration tests.
- An open GitHub Issue for actionable upstream work. Coding agents require that Issue to be explicitly assigned or explicitly selected before they begin.

## Use repository commands instead of underlying tools

The root scripts encode project selection, dependency ordering, caching, generated outputs, security policy, and delivery checks. Prefer `pnpm` and Nx commands over direct `next`, `nest`, `tsc`, `eslint`, or `vitest` invocation.

Run all commands from the workspace root.

## Standard agent iteration loop

For each scoped Issue:

1. Confirm the explicitly assigned or explicitly selected GitHub Issue is open, then read its full scope and acceptance criteria.
2. Read the root and closest nested `AGENTS.md`.
3. Inspect the target with `pnpm nx show project <PROJECT_NAME>` and the project graph.
4. Identify the source of truth and use a local generator for repeated structure.
5. Make the smallest coherent change through public package boundaries.
6. Run focused type checking, tests, and builds.
7. Run `pnpm affected` while iterating across dependent projects.
8. Run `pnpm format` and `pnpm check` before handoff.
9. Review the diff, generated files, migrations, acceptance-criteria evidence, and remaining human decisions.

If no Issue is explicitly selected or assigned, an agent does not search repository prose or a milestone for the next task. New actionable work must first exist as a GitHub Issue.

See [Agentic Development Model](Agentic-Development-Model) for the complete operating model and approval boundaries.

## Start local development

```bash
pnpm infra:up
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm dev` executes available `dev` and `serve` targets through Nx.

## Run one application

```bash
pnpm nx run web:dev
pnpm nx run api:serve
pnpm nx run worker:serve
```

The web target is inferred by the Nx Next plugin. API and worker targets are defined in their `project.json` files.

Inspect a target before using it:

```bash
pnpm nx show project <PROJECT_NAME>
```

## Run affected validation

For a focused branch:

```bash
pnpm affected
```

Equivalent explicit form:

```bash
pnpm nx affected -t lint typecheck test build
```

Nx compares the current work to the configured base branch (`main`) and includes dependent projects.

## Format

Write formatting changes:

```bash
pnpm format
```

Check only:

```bash
pnpm format:check
```

## Lint and type check

Repository-wide:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
```

Focused project:

```bash
pnpm nx run <PROJECT_NAME>:lint
pnpm nx run <PROJECT_NAME>:typecheck
```

Examples:

```bash
pnpm nx run api:typecheck
pnpm nx run worker:typecheck
pnpm nx run web:typecheck
```

## Test

Repository-wide:

```bash
pnpm test
```

Focused:

```bash
pnpm nx run <PROJECT_NAME>:test
```

Database tests use PostgreSQL containers and can take longer:

```bash
pnpm nx run database:test
```

Run without Nx cache when validating security or stateful behavior:

```bash
pnpm nx run api:test --skip-nx-cache
```

## Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

Focused:

```bash
pnpm nx run <PROJECT_NAME>:build
```

A production web build requires an explicit browser authentication profile. In CI the generic build sets:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHENTICATION_PROFILE=none pnpm nx run web:build
```

For a real release, select `oidc`, `session`, or intentionally `none`.

## Inspect the graph

```bash
pnpm graph
pnpm nx show projects
pnpm nx show project <PROJECT_NAME>
```

Use the graph before changing an import boundary or deleting a project.

## Add dependencies

Add a root development tool:

```bash
pnpm add -D -w <PACKAGE>
```

Add a dependency to a workspace package:

```bash
pnpm --filter <PACKAGE_NAME> add <DEPENDENCY>
```

After dependency changes:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm nx sync
pnpm check
```

Commit `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` together. Do not edit lockfile entries manually.

## Work with environment variables

1. Add the variable to the relevant validated configuration schema.
2. Add a safe example to `.env.example` or the correct `infra/environments/*.example`.
3. Pass it explicitly through Compose, Docker build arguments, or runtime configuration.
4. Update production validation when the variable is security- or delivery-critical.
5. Never commit a real secret.

Browser variables beginning with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are compiled into the web bundle. Changing them only at container runtime does not change an already-built image.

## Stop and restart infrastructure

```bash
pnpm infra:down
pnpm infra:up
```

Inspect state:

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs postgres
```

The named PostgreSQL volume is retained. Use the destructive volume-removal procedure in [Database and Data Management](Database-and-Data-Management) only for disposable data.

## Prepare a reviewable agent handoff

Before opening a pull request, an agent should summarize the selected Issue, intended behavior, projects changed, boundaries affected, validation run, and any production or human follow-up. The summary complements the diff; it does not replace review.

When the local reviewer bridge is used, the handoff carries `TASK: #<issue>` and the exact full PR head SHA. A new head requires a new review state.

## Prepare a pull request

```bash
pnpm format
pnpm affected
pnpm check
pnpm template:identity:check
git status --short
```

Then review:

```bash
git diff --stat
git diff
```

For upstream SteadyStack work, PRs normally use `Closes #<issue>` and map evidence to the selected Issue acceptance criteria. Generated-workspace application teams may define their own planning policy, but the upstream template does not copy a maintainer Markdown roadmap into initialized products.
