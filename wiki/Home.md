# SteadyStack

SteadyStack is a production-minded TypeScript web-application template designed to become the foundation for many different products that are built and maintained substantially by AI and coding agents under human ownership.

The workspace includes a Next.js web application, NestJS API, PostgreSQL-backed worker, shared contracts, validated configuration, deterministic generators, and production-shaped delivery controls in one Nx monorepo. Its defining goal is not simply to provide these technologies together. It is to make the repository legible, constrained, and verifiable enough that an agent can enter with no prior conversation history, find the correct change boundary, create approved structure, receive fast feedback, and produce a reviewable handoff.

> **Important:** Agentic-compatible development is a repository operating model, not an AI feature in the product. The optional `--ai=true` profile records product intent to add AI capabilities; it is unrelated to whether coding agents can work effectively in the repository.

> **Production warning:** A generated workspace that starts locally, passes validation, or was largely implemented by agents is **not automatically production-ready**. The adopting team must still own identity-provider integration, production data services, secrets, telemetry, deployment infrastructure, risk acceptance, rollback, disaster recovery, and operational support.

## Primary design goal

The template makes the preferred engineering path explicit and executable:

- layered `AGENTS.md` files tell contributors and agents which rules apply near the code;
- the Nx project graph and project tags expose ownership and dependency direction;
- `.mcp.json` makes Nx workspace context available to compatible agent clients;
- local generators create domains, features, jobs, and contracts with approved structure;
- ESLint, TypeScript, generated-contract checks, and project references enforce boundaries;
- focused Nx targets and affected commands provide fast iteration;
- `pnpm check`, preview validation, production gates, and release evidence provide objective completion criteria;
- versioned template provenance and ownership-aware upgrades support long-lived generated projects.

Read [Agentic Development Model](Agentic-Development-Model) before establishing an agent-led workflow.

## What the platform includes

### Agent-facing repository controls

- Root and subsystem-specific `AGENTS.md` guidance.
- Nx project graph, caching, affected commands, architectural tags, and MCP configuration.
- Deterministic workspace initialization and local structural generators.
- Stable root commands for formatting, testing, validation, preview, and upgrades.
- Generated contracts with drift and compatibility checks.
- Versioned template provenance, migration tooling, and file-ownership policy.

### Application and operational foundation

- A Next.js App Router web application.
- A NestJS HTTP API with generated runtime contract enforcement.
- A Node.js worker that consumes a PostgreSQL transactional outbox.
- Framework-free Agent Task and rate-limit libraries.
- Shared UI, contracts, PostgreSQL migrations, environment validation, and observability.
- Production OCI image builds, a local preview stack, smoke tests, performance budgets, SBOMs, vulnerability policy, signatures, attestations, immutable release manifests, finalized release-record evidence, and production configuration validation.
- Optional, default-off AI runtime primitives for provider-neutral model access, typed authorized tools, versioned browser streaming, and reviewed prompt/evaluation evidence.

## What it does not include

The template does not provide:

- a hosted coding-agent service, a default LLM choice, or an autonomous production operator;
- organization-specific agent credentials or permission policy;
- an organization-specific cloud deployment or Kubernetes manifests;
- identity-provider login, callback, and logout implementation;
- a production session store or Redis worker adapter;
- a composed model-backed application in the default profile, a default model provider, provider credentials, durable agent execution, or complete runtime AI safety/fallback policy;
- production backups, DNS/TLS, dashboards, alert routing, or incident ownership.

The upstream source now contains optional AI model/tool/stream/evaluation boundaries, but `ai=true` still records product intent rather than generating a runnable AI application. See [Optional AI Runtime](Optional-AI-Runtime).

Supported profiles can record some product or platform directions without implementing them.

## Start here

1. [Understand the Agentic Development Model](Agentic-Development-Model), including the standard agent workflow and human approval boundaries.
2. [Choose workspace profiles](Choosing-Workspace-Profiles) for applications, authentication, worker delivery, telemetry, deployment, and optional product AI intent.
3. If you are composing runtime AI behavior, read [Optional AI Runtime](Optional-AI-Runtime) for the default-off boundary, model/tool contracts, streaming protocol, evaluation evidence, and remaining Phase 14 gaps.
4. [Complete the Quick Start](Quick-Start) to create, initialize, map, run, and validate a local workspace.
5. [Tour the repository](Repository-Tour) and inspect its Nx project graph.
6. [Learn everyday development](Everyday-Development), [code generation](Code-Generation), and [validation](Validation-and-Testing).
7. Review [Production Readiness](Production-Readiness) before connecting shared or production environments.

## Current roadmap status

Roadmap status is mirrored from the repository's authoritative [`docs/TODO.md`](https://github.com/kaleigh-dem/steady-stack/blob/main/docs/TODO.md); the wiki does not maintain an independent task ledger.

- **Phase 13 — complete:** P13-01 through P13-06 established supply-chain evidence, immutable digest promotion, CI diagnostics/caching, cache-input and affected-execution validation, documentation integrity, and finalized release/recovery evidence. No additional Phase 13 implementation is planned.
- **Phase 14 — active and optional:** P14-01 through P14-04 are complete. The repository now has the optional profile boundary, provider-neutral model interfaces and adapters, typed authorized tools plus V1 agent streaming, and reviewed prompt/evaluation evidence without composing runtime AI into the default applications.
- **Next — P14-05:** add optional durable execution for checkpointing, resumable runs, human approval, and recovery after interruption while keeping durable-agent frameworks out of the default profile.

Use `docs/TODO.md` for sequencing, acceptance criteria, and future status changes.

## SteadyStack identity

PR #61 established the SteadyStack public identity across the repository, package scope, plugin, upgrade executable, release artifact, generated-workspace provenance, workflows, and documentation. New workspaces use `kaleigh-dem/steady-stack`, while generated products choose and retain their own application identity.

The repository had no released generated users before SteadyStack became the canonical public identity, so the end-user wiki documents only the current names. Historical rename notes remain in `docs/steadystack-migration.md` for maintainers.

## By role

### Evaluating the template

Read [Agentic Development Model](Agentic-Development-Model), [Architecture](Architecture), [Repository Tour](Repository-Tour), and [Choosing Workspace Profiles](Choosing-Workspace-Profiles). If runtime AI matters to the product, also review [Optional AI Runtime](Optional-AI-Runtime).

### Creating an agent-led product workspace

Follow [Quick Start](Quick-Start), customize the root and nested agent guidance for the product, then complete [Repository and GitHub Setup](Repository-and-GitHub-Setup).

### Developing applications

Use [Everyday Development](Everyday-Development), [Code Generation](Code-Generation), [Validation and Testing](Validation-and-Testing), and the root plus closest nested `AGENTS.md` files. For model/tool/prompt changes, also follow [Optional AI Runtime](Optional-AI-Runtime) and the evaluation-evidence gate.

### Configuring infrastructure

Use [Authentication and Authorization](Authentication-and-Authorization), [Database and Data Management](Database-and-Data-Management), [Containers and Preview Environments](Containers-and-Preview-Environments), [Image Supply Chain](Image-Supply-Chain), and [Production Readiness](Production-Readiness).

### Operating production

Use [Worker and Background Jobs](Worker-and-Background-Jobs), [Image Supply Chain](Image-Supply-Chain), [Production Readiness](Production-Readiness), [Releases and Upgrades](Releases-and-Upgrades), and [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting). Agents may prepare evidence and draft procedures; accountable operators approve and execute production decisions.

## Agent and human operating model

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Intent[Human intent and acceptance criteria] --> Agent[Human or AI implementation agent]
  Agent --> Context[AGENTS.md + Nx graph + ADRs + contracts]
  Context --> Change[Generators + scoped code changes]
  Change --> Feedback[Focused Nx targets + affected checks]
  Feedback --> Contract[pnpm check + preview + release evidence]
  Contract --> Review[Human review and approval]
  Review --> Product[Generated product repository]
```

The repository supplies the context and guardrails. Agents can explore, generate, implement, test, and prepare evidence. Humans remain responsible for product intent, architecture exceptions, access policy, production risk, and operational approval.

## Application system overview

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Browser[Browser] --> Web[Next.js web]
  Web -->|Bearer access token| API[NestJS API]
  API --> Contracts[Generated runtime contracts]
  API --> Domain[Framework-free domain]
  Domain --> DB[(PostgreSQL)]
  DB --> Outbox[Transactional outbox]
  Outbox --> Worker[Node.js worker]
  Worker --> Domain
  API --> RateLimit[PostgreSQL rate limits]
  Web --> Telemetry[OTLP telemetry]
  API --> Telemetry
  Worker --> Telemetry
```

The web application obtains an access token through the configured browser authentication adapter and calls the API through generated client code. The API validates transport contracts, authenticates and authorizes the request, executes framework-free application behavior, and writes application data plus outbox events transactionally. The worker leases outbox records, executes handlers at least once, and uses fencing and idempotency to make duplicate or stale delivery safe.

Optional AI primitives sit outside this default request/data flow until an application explicitly composes them.

## Source of truth

The wiki reorganizes end-user guidance from the repository implementation and maintained documentation. When a wiki statement conflicts with code, use the implementation and open a documentation correction. The [Documentation Audit](Documentation-Audit) records command verification, source mapping, discrepancies, and known gaps.
